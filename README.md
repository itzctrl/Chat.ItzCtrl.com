Fairly straight forward as to what this is. It's a basic live, anonymous (for now) chat where people can send messages from any device.

## Plans for future:
- Add user authentication ✔️
- Allow friend requests to be sent ✔️
  - Friends will be able to privately message each other ✔️
- Allow group chats to be made where 2 or more people can communicate
- Allow users to delete their own messages if needed 
- Implement the use of emojis
- Allow users to use Markdown in chats.

Really nothing too special about this, I'm just pretty happy with being able to get it all working and connected.
